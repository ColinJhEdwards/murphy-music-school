        "No other musical instrument expands as broadly into the essence of music as does the piano. Melody, harmony, bass, and rhythm reside right beneath your fingertips in black and white.",
      history:
        "The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700, in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter black keys, which are raised above the white keys, and set further back on the keyboard. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches, spanning a range of a bit over seven octaves. In the nineteenth century, a family's piano played the same role that a radio or phonograph played in the twentieth century; when a nineteenth-century family wanted to hear a newly published musical piece or symphony, they could hear it by having a family member play a simplified version on the piano. During the nineteenth century, music publishers produced many types of musical works (symphonies, opera overtures, waltzes, etc.) in arrangements for piano, so that music lovers could play and hear the popular pieces of the day in their home. The piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals.",

      why: "The physical and mental benefits of playing music have long been recognized. The piano, in particular, has been an unparalleled outlet for those seeking escape, creative expression, and simply fun and joy. Recent years have only seen more evidence of the benefits of piano come to light, linking music making to a healthy body, a healthy mind, and a healthy life. Piano practice also boosts cognitive and intellectual abilities, which is to say it makes you smarter and activates similar parts of the brain used in spatial reasoning and math. Children who had a few years of piano study under their belts could remember twenty percent more vocabulary words than their peers. And childhood musicians are better equipped later in life to retain information from speeches and lectures. Playing the piano offers a plethora of health benefits that will supplement every part of your life.",
      howLong:
        "The amount of time it takes to learn to play the piano depends on what level of playing you want to achieve. A person with no experience can learn to play the melody of a short song in minutes. For instance, if you want to play “Hot Cross Buns” you can master this simple song right away. On the other hand, let’s say you want to become a world-class classical pianist, and perform crazy-advanced pieces like Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto #3. If you want to be a professional classical performer, you’re looking at a minimum of 10 to 15 years of concentrated study with a master teacher, and hours of practice every day. Most people who want to play for their own enjoyment can get great results within three to five years of study and practice.",

      history:
        "A plucked stringed musical instrument that probably originated in Spain early in the 16th century, deriving from the guitarra latina, a late-medieval instrument with a waisted body and four strings. The early guitar was narrower and deeper than the modern guitar, with a less pronounced waist. It was closely related to the vihuela, the guitar-shaped instrument played in Spain in place of the lute. From the 16th to the 19th century several changes occurred in the instrument. A fifth course of strings was added before 1600; by the late 18th century a sixth course was added. Before 1800 the double courses were replaced by single strings tuned E–A–D–G–B–E, still the standard tuning. The guitar is widely played in the folk and popular music of many countries. In jazz ensembles it is part of the rhythm section and is occasionally played as a solo instrument. In popular music the guitar is usually amplified, and ensembles frequently include more than one instrument, a “lead” guitar for solos, another for rhythm, and a “bass” guitar to play bass lines.",
      why: "Whether it’s writing original material or reworking a song for your covers band, the guitar is unlike any other instrument for unleashing your creativity. We all have those moments when it’s hard to verbally express our feelings, but many guitarists find it easier to show their emotion, to process their feelings and to feel truly heard through playing the guitar. For most of our students, playing the guitar has became a hugely cathartic way to communicate their views, their feelings, passions and fear. Distilling it all into a haunting guitar riff, a blistering solo or a few simple chords, in a way they might never be able to with words. ",

        "With all our years of teaching, we have found that there is a general timeline for what you can expect when it comes to progressing. The key to success for our students is making practice fun. Pick songs and types of music you actually enjoy playing. When you enjoy what you’re learning, you practice more. You look forward to practice. You’re excited about practicing! The speed at which you learn will be dependent on a number of factors such as: The length of time you practice each day, your age (older students tend to learn faster most of the time), and your commitment to a regular weekly lesson schedule. The student that pracites for one hour everday is capable of reaching the skill level of an intermediate player within 1.5 years.",

        "The bass provides the rhythmic and harmonic foundation in music. It is a powerful bridge anchoring melody and harmony to the drums. Bass makes music feel good! The world needs more great bass players.",
      history:
        "The first known electric bass guitar was manufactured in the 1930s by Seattle-based inventor and musician Paul Tutmarc, but it wasn’t very successful. Leo Fender developed the Precision Bass, which made its debut in 1951. Minor modifications were made in the mid-50s. Since then, very few changes have been made to what quickly became the industry standard. The “P-Bass” is still the most commonly used bass guitar, and multitudes of copycats have been made by other manufacturers. A few years after the P-Bass, Fender introduced the Jazz Bass. It had a slimmer, easier-to-play neck and two pickups, one close to the bridge and the other close to the neck. This allowed for a wider tonal range. Despite its name, the “J-Bass” is widely used in all genres of modern music. Like the Precision, the Jazz’s shape and design has been emulated by numerous guitar makers. If there is a single bass guitar associated with one player, it is the Hofner violin bass, which is now commonly called the Beatle Bass because of its association with Paul McCartney. The legendary singer-songwriter cites its light weight and its ability to easily adapt to left-handed playing as his reasons for using it, even 50 years later.",

      why: "The bass is the heart and soul of most music and gives it the lower tones. The bass also tends to have more of a focus on rhythm, unlike the guitar, which focuses on melody. The bass can be felt by the audience. When a guitarist makes a mistake, it sounds wrong. When a bassist makes a mistake, it feels wrong. The audience and the band will feel that something’s wrong. Bassists are the driving force behind every song. They create the harmonic foundation for the other members of the group. Their role is to follow the rhythm and be the driving force behind the music.",
      howLong:
        "In our opinion, from the many students we have taught over the years, it should take about six months for you to learn the bass comfortably. This includes being able to play basic bass lines and scales with adequate fingering. However, everyone is different and there is no definite answer to that question. People often think that learning the bass guitar is easy. While there is some truth behind it, it’s not as simple as you expected because it’s not just a guitar with fewer strings. Some may be able to learn the bass guitar in just six months, while some need at least a year. And that’s only the basics. It would take years of practice, or even a lifetime, to master all the skills and advanced techniques.",

        "We've been home to a world class drummer since the beginning, and have helped train students to find success through their own personal rhythm. Drums are the backbone of most music genres.",
      history:
        "The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. They consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit. In popular music and jazz, 'drums' usually refers to a drum kit or a set of drums (with some cymbals, or in the case of harder rock music genres, many cymbals), and 'drummer' to the person who plays them.",

      why: "Learning to play the drums can serve as a powerful outlet and anchor, no matter what stage of life you're in. The instrument is probably one of the most active ways to play music. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Consequatur dolor nobis, inventore dolore repellendus dolorem harum ea, ad beatae ipsam quas expedita excepturi quisquam! Dolorem.",
      howLong:
        "The reality is that small amounts of practice can make a big difference when learning the drums. This is great news for aspiring drummers and hobbyists who want to see results quickly, and above all, want to have fun learning a musical instrument. How fast you progress on the drums depends on your goals, available practice time, and a structured plan. ",

      history:
        "Brass instruments have been around for a long time. Some of the earliest examples of brass instruments were straight trumpets made of wood, bronze, and silver, such as the salpinx found in Greece, and the Roman tuba, lituus, and buccina. Other early brass instruments were horns made of bronze or animal horns. The Scandinavian lur was one such instrument, as was the Roman, cornu. The shofar is an ancient Hebrew brass instrument made of a ram’s horn, which is still used in Jewish ceremonies today. During the Renaissance brass instruments began to develop that resemble the modern instruments in use today. Around 1400-1413 the earliest known S-shaped trumpet was developed, which was later followed by the folded trumpet and slide trumpet. ",

      why: "While most musical instruments can take years of practice brass are not as difficult to pick up. The hardest bit is learning to vary the pitch using your lips, once this is mastered beginners on brass can sound pretty good pretty quickly. Brass instruments are very versatile.  You find them in orchestral music, jazz and wind bands as well as, of course, brass bands. Once you can play one brass band instrument you can pretty much play the lot. How cool is that? ",
      howLong:
        "Although brass instruments are simple enough to learn, the challenge is in playing the instrument well, because that process takes time and effort, just like any learning process. The sooner you develop the habit of picking up your instrument every day the better. That being said, brass instruments are one of the easier instruments to learn and most beginners are capable of playing in a band within their first few months.",
