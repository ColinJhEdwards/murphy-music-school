        "No other musical instrument expands as broadly into the essence of music as does the piano. Melody, harmony, bass, and rhythm reside right beneath your fingertips in black and white.",
      history:
        "The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700, in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter black keys, which are raised above the white keys, and set further back on the keyboard. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches, spanning a range of a bit over seven octaves. In the nineteenth century, a family's piano played the same role that a radio or phonograph played in the twentieth century; when a nineteenth-century family wanted to hear a newly published musical piece or symphony, they could hear it by having a family member play a simplified version on the piano. During the nineteenth century, music publishers produced many types of musical works (symphonies, opera overtures, waltzes, etc.) in arrangements for piano, so that music lovers could play and hear the popular pieces of the day in their home. The piano is widely employed in classical, jazz, traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, and for composing, songwriting and rehearsals.",

      why: "The physical and mental benefits of playing music have long been recognized. The piano, in particular, has been an unparalleled outlet for those seeking escape, creative expression, and simply fun and joy. Recent years have only seen more evidence of the benefits of piano come to light, linking music making to a healthy body, a healthy mind, and a healthy life. Piano practice also boosts cognitive and intellectual abilities, which is to say it makes you smarter and activates similar parts of the brain used in spatial reasoning and math. Children who had a few years of piano study under their belts could remember twenty percent more vocabulary words than their peers. And childhood musicians are better equipped later in life to retain information from speeches and lectures. Playing the piano offers a plethora of health benefits that will supplement every part of your life.",
      howLong:
        "The amount of time it takes to learn to play the piano depends on what level of playing you want to achieve. A person with no experience can learn to play the melody of a short song in minutes. For instance, if you want to play “Hot Cross Buns” you can master this simple song right away. On the other hand, let’s say you want to become a world-class classical pianist, and perform crazy-advanced pieces like Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto #3. If you want to be a professional classical performer, you’re looking at a minimum of 10 to 15 years of concentrated study with a master teacher, and hours of practice every day. Most people who want to play for their own enjoyment can get great results within three to five years of study and practice.",

      history:
        "A plucked stringed musical instrument that probably originated in Spain early in the 16th century, deriving from the guitarra latina, a late-medieval instrument with a waisted body and four strings. The early guitar was narrower and deeper than the modern guitar, with a less pronounced waist. It was closely related to the vihuela, the guitar-shaped instrument played in Spain in place of the lute. From the 16th to the 19th century several changes occurred in the instrument. A fifth course of strings was added before 1600; by the late 18th century a sixth course was added. Before 1800 the double courses were replaced by single strings tuned E–A–D–G–B–E, still the standard tuning. The guitar is widely played in the folk and popular music of many countries. In jazz ensembles it is part of the rhythm section and is occasionally played as a solo instrument. In popular music the guitar is usually amplified, and ensembles frequently include more than one instrument, a “lead” guitar for solos, another for rhythm, and a “bass” guitar to play bass lines.",
      why: "Whether it’s writing original material or reworking a song for your covers band, the guitar is unlike any other instrument for unleashing your creativity. We all have those moments when it’s hard to verbally express our feelings, but many guitarists find it easier to show their emotion, to process their feelings and to feel truly heard through playing the guitar. For most of our students, playing the guitar has became a hugely cathartic way to communicate their views, their feelings, passions and fear. Distilling it all into a haunting guitar riff, a blistering solo or a few simple chords, in a way they might never be able to with words. ",
      howLong:
        "Most songs have some really fun riffs, licks & chord strumming patterns that you can take home with you after your very first lesson! Of course there are tons of more challenging songs that will take you longer. You will never get bored playing the guitar but you can learn parts of songs you know right away. The speed at which you learn will be dependent on a number of factors such as: The length of time you practice each day, your age (older students tend to learn faster most of the time), and your commitment to a regular weekly lesson schedule.",

      why: "The bass is the heart and soul of most music and gives it the lower tones. The bass also tends to have more of a focus on rhythm, unlike the guitar, which focuses on melody. The bass can be felt by the audience. When a guitarist makes a mistake, it sounds wrong. When a bassist makes a mistake, it feels wrong. The audience and the band will feel that something’s wrong. They’re the driving force behind every song. They create the harmonic foundation for the other members of the group. Their role is to follow the rhythm and be the driving force behind the music.",
